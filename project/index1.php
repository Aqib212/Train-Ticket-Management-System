<h2>National Reservations System (NRS)</h2>

<h5><strong>What's the problem?</strong></h5>
<p>We're sorry the National Reservations System appears to be down or slow to respond at present. This will affect our contact centres as well as our online channels.</p>


<p>As the National Reservations System provides ticket prices, information on the availability of advance purchase tickets and reservations, when the system is unavailable we are only able to show Anytime and Off-Peak tickets. Anytime and Off-Peak tickets may be more expensive than Advance tickets, depending on how far in advance you are looking to make your reservation.</p>

<h5><strong>What can I do about it?</strong></h5>

<p>We recommend that you check back on our site regularly to see whether access to the National Reservations System has been restored</p>
